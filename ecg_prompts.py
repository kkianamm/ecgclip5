"""
LLM-style prompt ensembles for BiomedCoOp on PTB-XL.

BiomedCoOp's two extra losses (SCCM + KDSP) need, for every class, a set of
descriptive sentences that a strong LLM (GPT-4 in the paper) would write about
how that class looks. In the official repo these live in
`trainers/prompt_templates.py` as `BIOMEDCOOP_TEMPLATES[classname] = [ ... ]`.

Here we provide the same structure for the 5 PTB-XL diagnostic superclasses.
The text is clinically-grounded description of the 12-lead ECG *image* (that is
what BiomedCLIP sees after `ecg_to_image.py` renders the waveform). You can
regenerate/extend these with an LLM of your choice; more, more-diverse prompts
generally help, and KDSP's outlier pruning will drop the unhelpful ones.

Keys are the PTB-XL superclass codes used everywhere else in the repo
(config.CLASSES). `readable_name(code)` gives the short phrase that goes into
the *learnable* prompt ("a photo of a <name>.").
